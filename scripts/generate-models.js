/**
 * generate-models.js
 * ------------------
 * This file has been intentionally neutralized â€” the project no longer uses
 * the generator. The original generator logic was removed to simplify the
 * repository. If you need to restore generation, re-add a generator script
 * or check version history to recover the previous implementation.
 *
 * Note: leaving this file as a marker avoids accidental re-introduction of
 * the generator without a conscious decision. You can safely delete this
 * file if you want it removed entirely from the repository.
